## General Standards for Statistical Software {#general-standards}

<details>
<summary>
Click for notes on nomenclature of Data Types.
</summary>
<p>

These standards refer to **Data Types** as the fundamental types defined by the
[R language](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-lang.html) itself between
the following:

- Logical
- Integer
- Continuous (`class = "numeric"` / `typeof = "double"`)
- Complex
- String / character

The base R system also includes what are considered here to be direct
extensions of fundamental types to include:

- Factor
- Ordered Factor
- Date/Time

The continuous type has a `typeof` of "double" because that represents the
storage mode in the C representation of such objects, while the `class` as
defined within R is referred to as "numeric". While `typeof` is not the same as
`class`, with reference to continuous variables, "numeric" may be considered
identical to "double" throughout.

The term "character" is interpreted here to refer to a vector each element of
which is an individual "character" object. The term "string" does not relate to
any official R nomenclature, but is used here to refer for convenience to
a character vector of length one; in other words, a "string" is the sole
element of a single-length "character" vector.

### Documentation

- **G1.0** *Statistical Software should list at least one primary reference
  from published academic literature.*

We consider that statistical software submitted under our system will either
(i) implement or extend prior methods, in which case the *primary reference*
will be to the most relevant published version(s) of prior methods; or (ii) be
an implementation of some new method. In the second case, it will be expected
that the software will eventually form the basis of an academic publication.
Until that time, the most suitable reference for equivalent algorithms or
implementations should be provided.

- **G1.1** *Statistical Software should document whether the algorithm(s) it
  implements are:*
    - *The first implementation of a novel algorithm*; or
    - *The first implementation within **R** of an algorithm which has
      previously been implemented in other languages or contexts*; or
    - *An improvement on other implementations of similar algorithms in **R***.

The second and third options additionally require references to comparable
algorithms or implementations to be documented somewhere within the software,
including references to all known implementations in other computer languages.

#### Statistical Terminology

- **G1.2** *All statistical terminology should be clarified and unambiguously
  defined.*

Developers should not presume anywhere in the documentation of software that
specific statistical terminology may be “generally understood”, and therefore
not need explicit clarification. Even terms which many may consider
sufficiently generic as to not require such clarification, such as “null
hypotheses” or “confidence intervals”, will generally need explicit
clarification. For example, both the estimation and interpretation of
confidence intervals are dependent on distributional properties and associated
assumptions. Any particular implementation of procedures to estimate or report
on confidence intervals will accordingly reflect assumptions on distributional
properties (among other aspects), both the nature and implications of which
must be explicitly clarified.

Standards will include requirements for form and completeness of documentation.
As with interface, several sources already provide starting points for
reasonable documentation. Some documentation requirements will be specific to
the statistical context. For instance, it is likely we will have requirements
for referencing appropriate literature or references for theoretical support of
implementations. Another area of importance is correctness and clarity of
definitions of statistical quantities produced by the software, e.g., the
definition of null hypotheses or confidence intervals. Data included in
software -- that used in examples or tests -- will also have documentation
requirements. It is worth noting that the
[`roxygen2`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/) system for documenting R packages is
readily extensible, as exemplified through the [`roxytest`
package](https://github.com/mikldk/roxytest) for specifying tests *in-line*.

#### Function-level Documentation

- **G1.3** *Software should use [`roxygen2`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/) to
  document all functions.*
    - **G1.2a** *All internal (non-exported) functions should also be documented
      in standard [`roxygen2`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/) format, along with
      a final `@noRd` tag to suppress automatic generation of `.Rd` files.*

#### Supplementary Documentation

The following standards describe several forms of what might be considered
"Supplementary Material". While there are many places within an R package where
such material may be included, common locations include vignettes, or in
additional directories (such as `data-raw`) listed in `.Rbuildignore` to
prevent inclusion within installed packages.

Where software supports a publication, all claims made in the publication with
regard to software performance (for example, claims of algorithmic scaling or
efficiency; or claims of accuracy), the following standard applies:

- **G1.4** *Software should include all code necessary to reproduce results which
  form the basis of performance claims made in associated publications.*

Where claims regarding aspects of software performance are made with respect to
other extant R packages, the following standard applies:

- **G1.5** *Software should include code necessary to compare performance claims
  with alternative implementations in other R packages.*



### Input Structures

This section considers general standards for *Input Structures*. These
standards may often effectively be addressed through implementing class
structures, although this is not a general requirement. Developers are
nevertheless encouraged to examine the guide to [S3
vectors](https://vctrs.r-lib.org/articles/s3-vector.html#casting-and-coercion)
in the [`vctrs` package](https://vctrs.r-lib.org) as an example of the kind of
assurances and validation checks that are possible with regard to input data.
Systems like those demonstrated in that vignette provide a very effective way
to ensure that software remains robust to diverse and unexpected classes and
types of input data.

#### Uni-variate (Vector) Input

It is important to note for univariate data that single values in R are vectors
with a length of one, and that `1` is of exactly the same *data type* as `1:n`.
Given this, inputs expected to be univariate should:

- **G2.0** *Implement assertions on lengths of inputs, particularly through asserting that inputs expected to be single- or multi-valued are indeed so.*
    - **G2.0a** Provide explicit secondary documentation of any expectations on
      lengths of inputs
- **G2.1** *Implement assertions on types of inputs (see the initial point on
  nomenclature above).*
    - **G2.1a** *Provide explicit secondary documentation of expectations on
      data types of all vector inputs.*
- **G2.2** *Appropriately prohibit or restrict submission of multivariate input to
  parameters expected to be univariate.*
- **G2.3** *For univariate character input:*
    - **G2.3a** *Use `match.arg()` or equivalent where applicable to only permit expected values.*
    - **G2.3b** *Either: use `tolower()` or equivalent to ensure input of character parameters is not case dependent; or explicitly document that parameters are strictly case-sensitive.*
- **G2.4** *Provide appropriate mechanisms to convert between different data types, potentially including:*
    - **G2.4a** *explicit conversion to `integer` via `as.integer()`*
    - **G2.4b** *explicit conversion to continuous via `as.numeric()`*
    - **G2.4c** *explicit conversion to character via `as.character()` (and not `paste` or `paste0`)*
    - **G2.4d** *explicit conversion to factor via `as.factor()`*
    - **G2.4e** *explicit conversion from factor via `as...()` functions*
- **G2.5** *Where inputs are expected to be of `factor` type, secondary
  documentation should explicitly state whether these should be `ordered` or
  not, and those inputs should provide appropriate error or other routines to
  ensure inputs follow these expectations.*

A few packages implement R versions of "static type" forms common in other
languages, whereby the type of a variable must be explicitly specified prior to
assignment. Use of such approaches is encouraged, including but not restricted
to approaches documented in packages such as
[`vctrs`](https://vctrs.r-lib.org), or the experimental package
[`typed`](https://github.com/moodymudskipper/typed).


#### Tabular Input

This sub-section concerns input in "tabular data" forms, implying the two
primary distinctions within R itself between `array` or `matrix`
representations, and `data.frame` and associated representations. Among
important differences between these two forms are that `array`/`matrix` classes
are restricted to storing data of a single uniform type (for example, all
`integer` or all `character` values), whereas `data.frame` as associated
representations store each column as a list item, allowing different columns to
hold values of different types. Further noting that
a `matrix` may, [as of R version
4.0](https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2019/11/09/when-you-think-class.-think-again/index.html),
be considered as a strictly two-dimensional array, tabular inputs for the
purposes of these standards are considered to imply data represented in one or
more of the following forms:

Given this, tabular inputs may be in one or or more of the following forms:

- `matrix` form when referring to specifically two-dimensional data of one
  uniform type
- `array` form as a more general expression, or when referring to data that are
  not necessarily or strictly two-dimensional
- `data.frame`
- Extensions such as
    - [`tibble`](https://tibble.tidyverse.org)
    - [`data.table`](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table)
    - domain-specific classes such as
      [`tsibble`](https://tsibble.tidyverts.org) for time series, or
      [`sf`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) for spatial data.

Both `matrix` and `array` forms are actually stored as vectors with a single
`storage.mode`, and so all of the preceding standards **G2.0**--**G2.5** apply.
The other rectangular forms are not stored as vectors, and do not necessarily
have a single `storage.mode` for all columns. These forms are referred to
throughout these standards as "`data.frame`-type tabular forms", which may be
assumed to refer to data represented in either the `base::data.frame` format,
and/or any of the classes listed in the final of the above points.

General Standards applicable to software which is intended to accept any one or
more of these `data.frame`-type tabular inputs are then that:

- **G2.6** *Software should accept as input as many of the above standard tabular
  forms as possible, including extension to domain-specific forms.*
- **G2.7** *Software should provide appropriate conversion or dispatch routines
  as part of initial pre-processing to ensure that all other sub-functions of
  a package receive inputs of a single defined class or type.*
- **G2.8** *Software should issue diagnostic messages for type conversion in which
  information is lost (such as conversion of variables from factor to
  character; standardisation of variable names; or removal of meta-data such as
  those associated with [`sf`-format](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) data) or
  added (such as insertion of variable or column names where none were
  provided).*

The next standard concerns the following inconsistencies between three common
tabular classes in regard the column extraction operator, `[`.

``` r
class (x) # x is any kind of `data.frame` object
#> [1] "data.frame"
class (x [, 1])
#> [1] "integer"
class (x [, 1, drop = TRUE]) # default
#> [1] "integer"
class (x [, 1, drop = FALSE])
#> [1] "data.frame"

x <- tibble::tibble (x)
class (x [, 1])
#> [1] "tbl_df"     "tbl"        "data.frame"
class (x [, 1, drop = TRUE])
#> [1] "integer"
class (x [, 1, drop = FALSE]) # default
#> [1] "tbl_df"     "tbl"        "data.frame"

x <- data.table::data.table (x)
class (x [, 1])
#> [1] "data.table" "data.frame"
class (x [, 1, drop = TRUE]) # no effect
#> [1] "data.table" "data.frame"
class (x [, 1, drop = FALSE]) # default
#> [1] "data.table" "data.frame"
```

- Extracting a single column from a `data.frame` returns a `vector` by default,
  and a `data.frame` if `drop = FALSE`.
- Extracting a single column from a `tibble` returns a single-column `tibble`
  by default, and a `vector` is `drop = TRUE`. 
- Extracting a single column from a `data.table` always returns a `data.table`,
  and the `drop` argument has no effect.

Given such inconsistencies, 

- **G2.9** *Software should ensure that extraction or filtering of single columns
  from tabular inputs should not presume any particular default behaviour, and
  should ensure all column-extraction operations behave consistently regardless
  of the class of tabular data used as input.*

Adherence to the above standard G2.6 will ensure that any implicitly or
explicitly assumed default behaviour will yield consistent results regardless
of input classes.

#### Missing or Undefined Values

- **G2.10** *Statistical Software should implement appropriate checks for missing
  data as part of initial pre-processing prior to passing data to analytic
  algorithms.*
- **G2.11** *Where possible, all functions should provide options for users to
  specify how to handle missing (`NA`) data, with options minimally including:*
  - **G2.11a** *error on missing data*
  - **G2.11b** *ignore missing data with default warnings or messages issued*
  - **G2.11c** *replace missing data with appropriately imputed values*
- **G2.12** *Functions should never assume non-missingness, and should never pass
  data with potential missing values to any base routines with default `na.rm =
  FALSE`-type parameters (such as
  [`mean()`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/mean.html),
  [`sd()`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/sd.html) or
  [`cor()`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/cor.html)).*
- **G2.13** *All functions should also provide options to handle undefined values 
  (e.g., `NaN`, `Inf` and `-Inf`), including potentially ignoring or removing
  such values.*

### Algorithms

- **G3.0** *Statistical software should never compare floating point numbers
  for equality. All numeric equality comparisons should either ensure that they
  are made between integers, or use appropriate tolerances for approximate
  equality.*

This standard applies to all computer languages included in any package. In R,
values can be affirmed to be integers through `is.integer()`, or asserting that
the `storage.mode()` of an object is "integer". One way to compare numeric
values with tolerance is with the [`all.equal()`
function](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/all.equal.html),
which accepts an additional `tolerance` parameter with a default for `numeric`
comparison of `sqrt(.Machine$double.eps)`, which is typically around e(-8--10).
In other languages, including C and C++, comparisons of floating point numbers
are commonly implemented by conditions such as `if (abs(a - b) < tol)`, where
`tol` specifies the tolerance for equality.

Importantly, R functions such as
[`duplicated()`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/duplicated.html)
and
[`unique()`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/unique.html)
rely on equality comparisons, and this standard extends to require that
software should not apply any functions which themselves rely on equality
comparisons to floating point numbers.

- G3.1 Statistical software which relies on covariance calculations should
  enable users to choose between different algorithms for calculating
  covariances, and should not rely solely on covariances from the `stats::cov`
  function.
    - G3.1a While it may be sufficient to offer a single default method, the
      ability to use arbitrarily specified methods should nevertheless be
      documented (typically in examples or vignettes).

Estimates of covariance can be very sensitive to outliers, and a variety of
methods have been developed for "robust" estimates of covariance, implemented
in such packages as [`rms`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rms),
[`robust`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=robust), and
[`sandwich`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sandwich). Adhering to this
standard merely requires an ability for a user to specify a particular
covariance function, such as through an additional parameter. The `stats::cov`
function can be used as a default, and additional packages such as the three
listed here need not necessarily be listed as `Imports` to a package.


### Output Structures

- **G4.0** *Statistical Software which enables outputs to be written to local files
  should parse parameters specifying file names to ensure appropriate file
  suffices are automatically generated where not provided.*

### Testing 

All packages should follow rOpenSci standards on
[testing](https://devguide.ropensci.org/building.html#testing) and [continuous
integration](https://devguide.ropensci.org/ci.html), including aiming for high
test coverage. Extant R packages which may be useful for testing include
[`testthat`](https://testthat.r-lib.org),
[`tinytest`](https://github.com/markvanderloo/tinytest),
[`roxytest`](https://github.com/mikldk/roxytest), and
[`xpectr`](https://github.com/LudvigOlsen/xpectr).

#### Test Data Sets

- **G5.0** *Where applicable or practicable, tests should use standard data sets
  with known properties (for example, the [NIST Standard Reference
  Datasets](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/strd/), or data sets provided by
  other widely-used R packages).*
- **G5.1** *Data sets created within, and used to test, a package should be
  exported (or otherwise made generally available) so that users can confirm
  tests and run examples.*

#### Responses to Unexpected Input

- **G5.2** *Appropriate error and warning behaviour of all functions should be
  explicitly demonstrated through tests. In particular,*
    - **G5.2a** *Every message produced within R code by `stop()`, `warning()`,
      `message()`, or equivalent should be unique*
    - **G5.2b** *Explicit tests should demonstrate conditions which trigger
      every one of those messages, and should compare the result with expected
      values.*
- **G5.3** *For functions which are expected to return objects containing no
  missing (`NA`) or undefined (`NaN`, `Inf`) values, the absence of any such
  values in return objects should be explicitly tested.*

#### Algorithm Tests

For testing _statistical algorithms_, tests should include tests of the
following types:

- **G5.4** **Correctness tests** *to test that statistical algorithms produce
   expected results to some fixed test data sets (potentially through
   comparisons using binding frameworks such as
   [RStata](https://github.com/lbraglia/RStata)).*
    - **G5.4a** *For new methods, it can be difficult to separate out correctness of the method from the correctness of the implementation, as there may not be reference for comparison.  In this case, testing may be implemented against simple, trivial cases or against multiple implementations such as an initial R implementation compared with results from a C/C++ implementation.*
    - **G5.4b** *For new implementations of existing methods, correctness tests should include tests against previous implementations.  Such testing may explicitly call those implementations in testing, preferably from fixed-versions of other software, or use stored outputs from those where that is not possible.*
    - **G5.4c** *Where applicable, stored values may be drawn from published paper outputs when applicable and where code from original implementations is not available*
- **G5.5** *Correctness tests should be run with a fixed random seed*
- **G5.6** **Parameter recovery tests** *to test that the implementation produce
  expected results given data with known properties.  For instance, a linear
  regression algorithm should return expected coefficient values for a
  simulated data set generated from a linear model.*
    - **G5.6a** *Parameter recovery tests should generally be expected to succeed within a defined tolerance rather than recovering exact values.*
    - **G5.6b** *Parameter recovery tests should be run with multiple random seeds when either data simulation or the algorithm contains a random component. (When long-running, such tests may be part of an extended, rather than regular, test suite; see G4.10-4.12, below).*
- **G5.7** **Algorithm performance tests** *to test that implementation performs
  as expected as properties of data change.  For instance, a test may show that
  parameters approach correct estimates within tolerance as data size
  increases, or that convergence times decrease for higher convergence
  thresholds.*
- **G5.8** **Edge condition tests** *to test that these conditions produce
  expected behaviour such as clear warnings or errors when confronted with data
  with extreme properties including but not limited to:*
    - **G5.8a** *Zero-length data*
    - **G5.8b** *Data of unsupported types (e.g., character or complex numbers in for functions designed only for numeric data)*
    - **G5.8c** *Data with all-`NA` fields or columns or all identical fields or columns*
    - **G5.8d** *Data outside the scope of the algorithm (for example, data with more fields (columns) than observations (rows) for some regression algorithms)*
- **G5.9** **Noise susceptibility tests** *Packages should test for expected
  stochastic behaviour, such as through the following conditions:*
    - **G5.9a** *Adding trivial noise (for example, at the scale of `.Machine$double.eps`) to data does not meaningfully change results*
    - **G5.9b** *Running under different random seeds or initial conditions does not meaningfully change results*

#### Extended tests

Thorough testing of statistical software may require tests on large data sets, 
tests with many permutations, or other conditions leading to long-running
tests. In such cases it may be neither possible nor advisable to execute tests
continuously, or with every code change. Software should nevertheless test any
and all conditions regardless of how long tests may take, and in doing so
should adhere to the following standards:

- **G5.10** *Extended tests should included and run under a common framework with
  other tests but be switched on by flags such as as a
  `<MYPKG>_EXTENDED_TESTS=1` environment variable.*
- **G5.11** *Where extended tests require large data sets or other assets, these
  should be provided for downloading and fetched as part of the testing
  workflow.*
    - **G5.11a** *When any downloads of additional data necessary for extended tests fail, the tests themselves should not fail, rather be skipped and implicitly succeed with an appropriate diagnostic message.*
- **G5.12** *Any conditions necessary to run extended tests such as platform
  requirements, memory, expected runtime, and artefacts produced that may need
  manual inspection, should be described in developer documentation such as a
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` or `tests/README.md` file.*
