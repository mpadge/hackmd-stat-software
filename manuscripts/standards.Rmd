# Introduction

Many aspects of human endeavour, notably including academic activities, have
become increasingly "open" through the use of openly published data and openly
available tools. Such open activity has been largely enabled by computational
technology, in particular increases in bandwidth available to share and access
online open resources. One notable example have been activities conducted in
accordance with the so-called "FAIR" principles for scientific data of
Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusablility
[@wilkinson_fair_2016]. The first two of those four components (Findability and
Accessibility) directly require some degree of openness to achieve, while the
latter two (Interoperability and Reusablility) are greatly facilitated or
enhanced by openness. This set of principles may accordingly be viewed as an
elucidation of the importance of openness within the context of scientific
data.

These principles extend beyond the domain of scientific data, for example
through to the tools used to develop and guide scientific process, and in
particular to software [@hasselbring_fair_2020]. Openness of software,
especially manifest through open-source software, is particularly important in
encouraging and enabling activities conducted in accordance with all four of
the FAIR principles. Using open-source software in scientific research
naturally leads to *sharing* software, which in turn leads to software being
inherently designed for Interoperability and Reusablility. The result is
software being designed to be (more) *modular*
[@zirkelbach_modularization_2019]. While such modularity is a very effective
way to enhance Interoperability and Reusablility, it also means that any given
piece of software will have a wider range of dependencies on other pieces of
software not directly under the control of any particular group of researchers.

Adherence to FAIR principles both of scientific data and process development
thus increases the need to ensure that interoperated and reused components are
of sufficient quality or standard. Extending the FAIR principles to scientific
process thus unavoidably requires the development of open standards. While
individual researchers and research organizations can themselves engage with
these principles largely independent of other researchers or organizations, the
ongoing effectiveness of these principles in transforming research to become
more *FAIR* ultimately requires the development, dissemination, and adoption of
open standards. And that can only be a collective enterprise which can not
effectively be approached from an individual level.

## Open Standards

We consider open standards to be those which are and continue to be guided by
public discussions, and to which anybody may contribute [referred to as open
"concerted" standards by @cerri_open_2007]. The development of adoption of open
standards is in itself an enacting of FAIR principles, because such standards
must reflect, among other aspects, an intention to enhance Interoperability and
Reusablility. Nevertheless, within software contexts, open standards have been
most widely considered in regard to formats for representing and/or exchanging
data (such as standards for "pdf" or "svg" file formats, respectively defined
and maintained by a closed private corporation, and the open Worldwide Web
Consortium). The development of such standards can often greatly facilitate the
development of standard tools (or the standardisation of existing tools), which
can in turn reduce costs, either or initial entry into, or ongoing maintenance
of, processes [@dedrick_why_2003].


The importance of open standards have been considered in numerous specialised
domains, such as health care [@reynolds_open_2011], libraries
[@corrado_importance_2005], and governance [@simon_value_2005].

## Restrictions of our Project

- Much of the empirical research was drawn from material ultimately arising
  from academic activities which are inherently open, and so provide sufficient
  material to define scope and usage of software.
- Adaptation to other areas with comparably less "raw data" available in open
  form may not be so straightforward.
- That said, the empirical research ultimately aimed only to construct
  a "network graph" of inter-relationships between concepts within our chosen
  domain. Any information that could be used to define concepts and their
  inter-relationships could be used to approach this task. For example, an
  analogous network graph could be derived by analysing dependency graphs of
  open-source software.

## Motivation

We aim here to document a process by which we developed a suite of open
standards for open-source software, and in doing so to provide a template able
to be adopted and adapted for Reusablility in other domains. More generally, we
aim to demonstrate an effective way to approach and hopefully overcome the
problem elucidated at the outset that individually-adopted FAIR principles
unavoidably require the development of collectively-consensual open standards.
This demonstration is intended to serve as a template for how FAIR principles
in other domains can be extended towards the development of sets of collective,
open standards, which further enables and enhances the ongoing development of
FAIR research.

## Context

Our area of application was statistical software written in the computer
language R, a language explicitly designed for "statistical computing". The
present work describes a project to expand an existing system for peer review
of open source software developed by an organization named *rOpenSci* to
accommodate explicitly statistical software. The current review system
encompasses several categories of software developed in the R language, yet
excludes statistical software, because the organization felt they had no
members with sufficient expertise in that domain. One of the most important
components of project to expand the scope to include statistical software was
the development of a set of standards for statistical software. All empirical
descriptions of the present work thus pertain to the specific domain of
statistical software, yet we attempt throughout to extract general or
generalizable principles behind this specific application, and to explore how
our domain-specific processes might be adapted for development in other
domains.

# Methods

The following methods 

## Defining Scope

- Collect "raw data" by:
    - Identifying online (or other) resources providing textual descriptions of
      software development and usage within our area of application.
    - Manually filter to only those texts specifically relating to software
- Analyse raw data by:
    - Initial text analyses to extract key words and concepts
    - Manually refine these to a working set of key words and concepts
    - Manually ascribe key words/concepts to each text in the data set
    - Convert texts to frequencies of association between all pairs of key words/concepts
- Extraction of key words/concepts:
    - Produce a visual representation of network of key words/concepts, with
      connections visually weighted by relative frequencies of association.
    - Use those relative frequencies of association to statistically identify
      clusters of similar key words/concepts.
    - Provide each distinct cluster within the visualization with its own colour
    - Use that visualization to identify distinct clusters of key words/concepts
- Mapping key words/concepts onto sub-categories:
    - For each key word/concept, extract from the text corpus all strongly
      associated words, divided into different parts of speech (primarily
      adjectives, nouns, or verbs).
    - Use the resultant lists of associated words to formulate an initial
      description of that key word/concept as a potential sub-category for
      which to develop standards.

## Formulating Standards

- Process used / devised to derive actual standards for the empirically derived
  set of candidate categories.
