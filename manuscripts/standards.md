# On Developing Standards for Open-Source Software

## Aims

- To document a process by which we developed standards for open source
  software within a defined area of application
- To do so in a way that will be transferable to other areas of application,
  including other computer languages.
- To attempt to elucidate a set of general principles which may be adapted by
  others to develop standards for software in any area of application.

## Introduction

- Increasing importance of standards for software
- Increasing application of Open Source Software; "Working in Public" by Nadia Eghbal

### Need for Standards

- Examples of FDA + EU standards for pharma workflows including software; R Validation Hub

### Open vs Closed Source

- Commercial organizations make money from software assessment, but first
  motivation is money not consistency or general applicability of assessment
  techniques.
- Open Source software is comparably more diverse and does not (need to)
  conform to any standards.

### Restrictions of our Project

- Much of the empirical research was drawn from material ultimately arising
  from academic activities which are inherently open, and so provide sufficient
  material to define scope and usage of software.
- Adaptation to other areas with comparably less "raw data" available in open
  form may not be so straightforward.

## Methods

### Defining Scope

- Collect "raw data" by:
    - Identifying online (or other) resources providing textual descriptions of
      software development and usage within our area of application.
    - Manually filter to only those texts specifically relating to software
- Analyse raw data by:
    - Initial text analyses to extract key words and concepts
    - Manually refine these to a working set of key words and concepts
    - Manually ascribe key words/concepts to each text in the data set
    - Convert texts to frequencies of association between all pairs of key words/concepts
- Extraction of key words/concepts:
    - Produce a visual representation of network of key words/concepts, with
      connections visually weighted by relative frequencies of association.
    - Use those relative frequencies of association to statistically identify
      clusters of similar key words/concepts.
    - Provide each distinct cluster within the visualization with its own colour
    - Use that visualization to identify distinct clusters of key words/concepts
- Mapping key words/concepts onto sub-categories:
    - For each key word/concept, extract from the text corpus all strongly
      associated words, divided into different parts of speech (primarily
      adjectives, nouns, or verbs).
    - Use the resultant lists of associated words to formulate an initial
      description of that key word/concept as a potential sub-category for
      which to develop standards.

### Formulating Standards

The next task was to derive actual standards for the empirically derived set of
candidate categories.
