## Regression and Supervised Learning

This document details standards for Regression and Supervised Learning
Software -- referred to from here on for simplicity as "Regression Software".
Regression Software implements algorithms which aim to construct or analyse one
or more mappings between two defined data sets (for example, a set of
"independent" data, $X$, and a set of "dependent" data, $Y$). In contrast, the
analogous category of Unsupervised Learning Software aims to construct or
analyse one or more mappings between a defined set of input or independent
data, and a second set of "output" data which are not necessarily known or
given prior to the analysis.

Common purposes of Regression Software are to fit models to estimate
relationships or to make predictions between specified inputs and outputs.
Regression Software includes tools with inferential or predictive foci,
Bayesian, frequentist, or probability-free Machine Learning (ML) approaches,
parametric or or non-parametric approaches, discrete outputs (such as in
classification tasks) or continuous outputs, and models and algorithms specific
to applications or data such as time series or spatial data.  In many cases
other standards specific to these subcategories may apply.

The following standards are divided among several sub-categories, with each
standard prefixed with "RE".



### Input data structures and validation

- **RE1.0** *Regression Software should enable models to be specified via a formula
  interface, unless reasons for not doing so are explicitly documented.*
- **RE1.1** *Regression Software should document how formula interfaces are
  converted to matrix representations of input data. See Max Kuhn's [RStudio
  blog
  post](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2017/02/01/the-r-formula-method-the-good-parts/)
  for examples.*
- **RE1.2** *Regression Software should document expected format (types or
  classes) for inputting predictor variables, including descriptions of types
  or classes which are not accepted; for example, specification that software
  accepts only numeric inputs in `vector` or `matrix` form, or that all inputs
  must be in `data.frame` form with both column and row names.*
- **RE1.3** *Regression Software should transfer all relevant aspects of input
  data, notably including row and column names, and potentially information
  from other `attributes()`, to corresponding aspects of return objects (see
  RE4, below).*
    - **RE1.3a** *Where otherwise relevant information is not transferred, this should be explicitly documented.*
- **RE1.4** *Regression Software should document any assumptions made with regard to
  input data; for example distributional assumptions, or assumptions that
  predictor data have mean values of zero. Implications of violations of these
  assumptions should be both documented and tested.*

### Pre-processing and Variable Transformation

- **RE2.0** *Regression Software should document any transformations applied to
  input data, for example conversion of label-values to `factor`, and should
  provide ways to explicitly avoid any default transformations (with error or
  warning conditions where appropriate).*
- **RE2.1** *Regression Software should implement explicit parameters controlling
  the processing of missing values, ideally distinguishing `NA` or `NaN` values
  from `Inf` values (for example, through use of `na.omit()` and related
  functions from the `stats` package).*
- **RE2.2** *Regression Software should provide different options for processing
  missing values in predictor and response data. For example, it should be
  possible to fit a model with no missing predictor data in order to generate
  values for all associated response points, even where submitted response
  values may be missing.*
- **RE2.3** *Where applicable, Regression Software should enable data to be centred
  (for example, through converting to zero-mean equivalent values; or to
  z-scores) or offset (for example, to zero-intercept equivalent values) via
  additional parameters, with the effects of any such parameters clearly
  documented and tested.*
- **RE2.4** *Regression Software should implement pre-processing routines to
  identify whether aspects of input data are perfectly collinear, notably
  including:*
    - **RE2.4a** *Perfect collinearity among predictor variables*
    - **RE2.4b** *Perfect collinearity between independent and dependent variables*

These pre-processing routines should also be tested as described below.

### Algorithms

The following standards apply to the model fitting algorithms of Regression
Software which implements or relies on iterative algorithms which are expected
to converge to generate model statistics. Regression Software which implements
or relies on iterative convergence algorithms should:

- **RE3.0** *Issue appropriate warnings or other diagnostic messages for models
  which fail to converge.*
- **RE3.1** *Enable such messages to be optionally suppressed, yet should ensure
  that the resultant model object nevertheless includes sufficient data to
  identify lack of convergence.*
- **RE3.2** *Ensure that convergence thresholds have sensible default values,
  demonstrated through explicit documentation.*
- **RE3.3** *Allow explicit setting of convergence thresholds, unless reasons
  against doing so are explicitly documented.*


### Return Results

- **RE4.0** *Regression Software should return some form of "model" object,
  generally through using or modifying existing class structures for model
  objects (such as `lm`, `glm`, or model objects from other packages), or
  creating a new class of model objects.*
- **RE4.1** *Regression Software may enable an ability to generate a model object
  without actually fitting values. This may be useful for controlling batch
  processing of computationally intensive fitting algorithms.*

#### Accessor Methods

Regression Software should provide functions to access or extract as much of
the following kinds of model data as possible or practicable. Access should
ideally rely on class-specific methods which extend, or implement otherwise
equivalent versions of, the methods from the `stats` package which are named in
parentheses in each of the following standards.

Model objects should include, or otherwise enable effectively immediate access
to the following descriptors. It is acknowledged that not all regression models
can sensibly provide access to these descriptors, yet should include access
provisions to all those that are applicable.

- **RE4.2** *Model coefficients (via `coeff()` / `coefficients()`)*
- **RE4.3** *Confidence intervals on those coefficients (via `confint()`)*
- **RE4.4** *The specification of the model, generally as a formula (via
  `formula()`)*
- **RE4.5** *Numbers of observations submitted to model (via `nobs()`)*
- **RE4.6** *The variance-covariance matrix of the model parameters (via `vcov()`)*
- **RE4.7** *Where appropriate, convergence statistics*

Regression Software *should* provide simple and direct methods to return or
otherwise access the following form of data and metadata, where the latter
includes information on any transformations which may have been applied to the
data prior to submission to modelling routines.

- **RE4.8** *Response variables, and associated "metadata" where applicable.*
- **RE4.9** *Modelled values of response variables.*
- **RE4.10** *Model Residuals, including sufficient documentation to enable
  interpretation of residuals, and to enable users to submit residuals to their
  own tests.*
- **RE4.11** *Goodness-of-fit and other statistics associated such as effect sizes
  with model coefficients.*
- **RE4.12** *Where appropriate, functions used to transform input data, and
  associated inverse transform functions.*

Regression software *may* provide simple and direct methods to return or
otherwise access the following:

- **RE4.13** *Predictor variables, and associated "metadata" where applicable.*

#### Prediction, Extrapolation, and Forecasting

Not all regression software is intended to, or can, provide distinct abilities
to extrapolate or forecast. Moreover, identifying cases in which a regression
model is used to extrapolate or forecast may often be a non-trivial exercise.
It may nevertheless be possible, for example when input data used to construct
a model are unidimensional, and data on which a prediction is to be based
extend beyond the range used to construct the model. Where reasonably
unambiguous identification of extrapolation or forecasting using a model is
possible, the following standards apply:

- **RE4.14** *Where possible, values should also be provided for extrapolation
  or forecast *errors*.*
- **RE4.15** *Sufficient documentation and/or testing should be provided to
  demonstrate that forecast errors, confidence intervals, or equivalent values
  increase with forecast horizons.*

Distinct from extrapolation or forecasting abilities, the following standard
applies to regression software which relies on, or otherwise provides abilities
to process, categorical grouping variables:

- **RE4.16** *Regression Software which models distinct responses for different
  categorical groups should include the ability to submit new groups to
  `predict()` methods.*

#### Reporting Return Results

- **RE4.17** *Model objects returned by Regression Software should implement or
  appropriately extend a default `print` method which provides an on-screen
  summary of model (input) parameters and (output) coefficients.*
- **RE4.18** *Regression Software may also implement `summary` methods for model
  objects, and in particular should implement distinct `summary` methods for
  any cases in which calculation of summary statistics is computationally
  non-trivial (for example, for bootstrapped estimates of confidence
  intervals).*

### Documentation

Beyond the general standards for documentation, Regression Software should
explicitly describe the following aspects, and ideally provide extended
documentation including summary graphical reports of: 

- **RE5.0** *Scaling relationships between sizes of input data (numbers of
  observations, with potential extension to numbers of variables/columns) and
  speed of algorithm.*

### Visualization

- **RE6.0** *Model objects returned by Regression Software (see RE3.0) should have
  default `plot` methods, either through explicit implementation, extension of
  methods for existing model objects, or through ensuring default methods work
  appropriately.*
- **RE6.1** *Where the default `plot` method is **NOT** a generic `plot` method
  dispatched on the class of return objects (that is, through
  a `plot.<myclass>` function), that method dispatch should nevertheless exist
  in order to explicitly direct users to the appropriate function.*
- **RE6.2** *The default `plot` method should produce a plot of the `fitted` values
  of the model, with optional visualisation of confidence intervals or
  equivalent.*

The following standard applies only to software fulfilling RE4.14-4.15, and the
conditions described prior to those standards.

- **RE6.3** *Where a model object is used to generate a forecast (for example,
  through a `predict()` method), the default `plot` method should provide clear
  visual distinction between modelled (interpolated) and forecast
  (extrapolated) values.*

### Testing

Tests for Regression Software should include the following conditions and cases:

- **RE7.0** *Tests with noiseless, exact relationships between predictor
  (independent) data.*
    - **RE7.0a** *In particular, these tests should confirm that model fitting is at
      least as fast or (preferably) faster than testing with equivalent noisy
      data (see RE2.4a).*
- **RE7.1** *Tests with noiseless, exact relationships between predictor
  (independent) and response (dependent) data.*
    - **RE7.1a** *In particular, these tests should confirm that model fitting is at
      least as fast or (preferably) faster than testing with equivalent noisy
      data (see RE2.4b).*
