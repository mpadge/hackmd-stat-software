# hackmd-stat-software

A mirror repo to hold [`hackmd`](https://hackmd.io) notes for [rOpenSci Statistical Software Project](https://hackmd.io/@stat-software). It's all `makefile` controlled, with `make copy` used to copy all `.Rmd` files over to the source repository for [`statistical-software-peer-review`](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/statistical-software-peer-review) so these files can remain a definitive source. They're all simply included in that document as `child` documents.
